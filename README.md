# s2member-payment-data Python Scripts

A bunch of small Python scripts allowing you to extract and post process the data from the Transactional Payments Emails created by the WordPress plugin S2member.  

They play nicely together and with all three scripts you can get a Telegram notification about yesterday's number of transactions and total income generated with S2member from your WordPress Membership Website.

You can automate the scripts to run one after the other with a cronjob.

Example:

- On your command line run crontab -e
- Make sure each script is executable: chmod +x /path/to/script.py
- Add entry for each script with short delays to start with the first one at 7:15 each morning:
     15 7 * * * python /path/to/s2email2csv.py
     17 7 * * * python /path/to/s2yesterdaysmessage.py
     19 7 * * * python /path/to/s2ymsgtelegram.py
